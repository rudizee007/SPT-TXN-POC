# Identity-provider integration — the proof

An existing OpenID Connect identity provider mints SPT-Txn credentials over
**standard OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange (RFC 8693)** — no rip-and-replace. Proven
end-to-end against **Keycloak**; the same flow targets Okta / Auth0 / Ping
unchanged.

## The flow

```
  alice ──login──▶ Keycloak (IdP)  ──OIDC access token──▶  idp-bridge
                                                              │  RFC 8693 token exchange
                                                              │  (verify token via JWKS, map claims)
                                                              ▼

                                                                            (no IdP contact)
                                                                            ──▶ delegated to an
                                                                                AI agent (CAT→CT→TXN)
```

## Standards it rides (all published RFCs)

| Standard | Role here |
|---|---|
| **RFC 8693 Token Exchange** | the grant that turns an IdP token into a CAT |
| **OIDC Discovery + JWKS** | how the bridge verifies the IdP token (`internal/oidc`) |
| **RFC 9449 DPoP** | binds the CAT to the holder/agent key (`internal/dpop`) |
| **RFC 9396 RAR** / custom `spt_scope` claim | source of the capability scope |
| RFC 7519 JWT (EdDSA) | the CAT is a standard compact JWT |

Nothing bespoke on the ingress — an IdP architect sees only OAuth they recognise.

## Components

| Piece | What it does |
|---|---|
| `internal/oidc` | OIDC discovery + JWKS + RS256 token verification (stdlib-only) |
| `cmd/idp-bridge` | RFC 8693 `/token` endpoint: verify IdP token → issue CAT → RFC 8693 response |
| `cmd/idp-verify` | offline CAT verification + tamper test (the portability proof) |
| `cmd/agentdemo` | CAT → CT → transaction-bound token, attenuation, offline revocation |
| `deploy/keycloak/` | one-command Keycloak (`docker compose`) + realm import |
| `scripts/idp-demo.sh` | runs the whole proof, 7 printed steps |

> Production note: `idp-bridge` is standalone so the proof runs anywhere. In
> production this logic folds into `cmd/catsvc` (the hardened, pledge/unveil CAT
> issuer) — it is the same `cattoken.Issue` call behind a different ingress.

## Run it

```sh
# 0. deps: docker, go, curl, jq, openssl
go test ./internal/oidc/                       # verify the OIDC verifier (no Keycloak needed)

# 1. start Keycloak (first boot ~30s)
(cd deploy/keycloak && docker compose up -d)

# 2. start the bridge (separate terminal)
SPT_IDP_AUDIENCE=account \
SPT_IDP_PERMITTED_SCOPE='{"action":"transfer","max_amount":10000,"currency":"USD"}' \
go run ./cmd/idp-bridge

# 3. run the proof
sh scripts/idp-demo.sh
```

Expected: a Keycloak token is exchanged for a CAT; the CAT verifies **offline**;
a tampered CAT is rejected; the agent-delegation engine runs `ALLOW`/`DENY`.

## Pointing it at Okta / Auth0 / Ping (no code change)

Set the bridge to the provider's issuer and (in production) its audience:

```sh
SPT_IDP_OIDC_ISSUER="https://<tenant>.okta.com/oauth2/default" \
SPT_IDP_AUDIENCE="api://spt" \
SPT_IDP_CAT_SEED_HEX="<pinned 32-byte issuer seed>" \
SPT_IDP_AUDIENCE=account \
SPT_IDP_PERMITTED_SCOPE='{"action":"transfer","max_amount":10000,"currency":"USD"}' \
go run ./cmd/idp-bridge
```

Because the ingress is OIDC discovery + JWKS + RFC 8693, any conformant provider
works; only the issuer URL and audience change.

## Honest boundaries

- **Keycloak *authenticates*; SPT-Txn *attests capability*.** The exchange binds an
  IdP-authenticated identity to a compliance/capability attestation — it does not
  turn the IdP into a KYC provider. In production the KYC/compliance issuer is the
  trusted party; here the bridge plays that role to demonstrate the flow.
- **RS256 only** in this build (Keycloak's default). ES256 is a small, marked
  extension point in `internal/oidc`.
- **The audience check is mandatory.** The bridge will not start without
  `SPT_IDP_AUDIENCE`. An earlier version of this line said the check was optional
  and off by default; that was never true of the bridge.
- **`azp` does not satisfy the audience check.** It names the client that asked
  for the token, not the resource entitled to consume it, so it is present on
  every token that client holds. Add an audience mapper in the IdP — Keycloak's
  default `aud` is `account`, so without a mapper the only value that matches is
  `account` itself.
- **The bridge does not ask the holder to prove possession.** `holder_key_hex` is
  taken as given and sealed into the CAT. Anyone may name any key.
- **A bridge-issued CAT cannot be revoked individually.** No `status` claim is
  set and the issuer key is not registered in the Trust Registry, so the only
  remedies are waiting out the TTL (24h max) or destroying the issuer key, which
  invalidates every CAT it ever signed.
- **DPoP is a documented POC subset.** The demo binds the CAT to a presented holder
  key; production binds the DPoP key the client actually proves.
- **Claims→scope mapping is deployment-specific.** The demo uses request `scope` >
  `spt_scope` claim > a default. Real deployments define their own (e.g. RFC 9396
  authorization_details).
- This is a **reference integration**, not a hardened commercial Okta/Ping connector
  — it proves interoperability and the flow.

## The claim it earns

> Your existing identity provider issues SPT-Txn compliance credentials through
> standard OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange (RFC 8693) — no migration. The credential then
> verifies offline anywhere, carries a privacy-preserving human anchor, and an AI
> agent can act under it with authority that can only narrow and can be revoked
> instantly. Demonstrated end-to-end against Keycloak.
